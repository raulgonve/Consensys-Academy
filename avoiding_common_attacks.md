Measures I took to ensure that my contracts are not susceptible to common attacks

1.- Logic Bugs
	- Run different test to prove the right work
	- Testing in the UI user tiping commons errors 
	- Using visual studio code for check that every single line code was write correctly
	- Doing simple code

2.- Failed Sends
	- 25 test to prove the sends works good
	- Tests with differents test blockchains

3.- Integer Arithmetic Overflow
	- Validating each number before use it in the code
	- Checking pre-conditions before use this numbers

4.- Poison Data
	- UI forms check the input users to prevent wrong data

5.- Exposed Secrets
	- No sensitive data in the project
