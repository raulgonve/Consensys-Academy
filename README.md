BountyDapp

Description: Create a bounty dApp where people can post or submit work.

User Stories:
As a job poster, I can create a new bounty. I will set a bounty description and include the amount to be paid for a successful submission. I am able to view a list of bounties that I have already posted. By clicking on a bounty, I can review submissions that have been proposed. I can accept or reject the submitted work. Accepting proposed work will pay the submitter the deposited amount.
 
As a bounty hunter, I can submit work to a bounty for review.
